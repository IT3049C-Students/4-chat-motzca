## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I believe I should get at least a 15/20 as  minimum. After watching all of the videos and writing the code by hand as an example, I 
got the hang of the objective for this week's lab.

## Self-Reflection:
This assignment seemed to be on the easier side. I took the time to fully write down code and notes for this weeek, which maybe everything click.
While the assignment was generous when giving examples, everything clicked as to why it would be incorporated.

### How long it took me to finish this?
This assignment took me about a hour and a half to code through everything.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
Bootstrap 'display-4' class is the most recent version of bootstraps. It allows the user to work with the CSS framework.
